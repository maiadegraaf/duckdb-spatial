# This test case comes from a bug report, where the indexed point-in-polygon check would not consider that
# the second vertex of the last segment in each index node neccessarily have to be the first vertex of the next segment.
# Therefore when performing a raycast from a point to a polygon where the ray would intersect
# the segment formed by the last vertex in a index leaf node, and the first vertex in the next segment, the result
# would be incorrect.
# To test this, we create a polygon with 40 vertices, causing two index leaf nodes (0-31, 33-40) to be created when
# preparing the polygon, and we then query a point that is to the left of the polygon, but right between the segment
# spanning the two nodes (31-32).
