# WKB Module

This module provides the `WKB_BLOB` type with associated casts and function overloads.
`WKB_BLOB` was used in previous versions of DuckDB Spatial to represent a geometry that is known to be in WKB format.
But this is now deprecated, and this module is only provided for backward compatibility.
